# Project title "The Future of Wearable Monitoring Devices"

I built a responsive, dynamic dashboard that displays vital health metrics from wearable devices. Built with React, Vite, and Tailwind CSS, it showcases real-time health data, bio, health tips, dark mode support, and a line chart visualization.


## Everything i did 
#Vitals Monitoring Dashboard

- Display of Heart Rate, Blood Oxygen, Temperature

- Applied green color to show when vitals are normal and red when in danger.

- Made sure there is timestamp for data freshness

#Danger Alert Banner
- Displays an alert if any vital is out of the normal range

- Supports dark mode for visualization.

#Responsive Line Chart
- Renders heart rate trends over time using Recharts

- Fully responsive via ResponsiveContainer

It was made with lots of love.
